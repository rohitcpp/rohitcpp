# 👋 Hey, I'm Rohit More!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **developer and problem solver** focused on building purposeful apps. While I'm not actively working on a major project at the moment, I'm fully immersed in **mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Java** — sharpening the blade before the next big battle.

## 🧠 My Current Focus: **Sharpening the Core with DSA + Java**

Right now, I'm not building — I'm training.  
I'm channeling my full energy into **Data Structures & Algorithms using Java**, solving problems daily, and preparing for what lies ahead in both interviews and real-world challenges. It's not a pause — it's a preparation phase.

> "Before constructing great things, a wise builder sharpens his tools."

## 📂 Past Project Highlight: **Filmcraft Studio** (Closed)

🎬 This was a passionate attempt to build a cross-platform video editing application using **QML and C++**, inspired by industry tools like Wondershare Filmora. Although the project is currently inactive, it laid a solid foundation for UI design and modular thinking.
