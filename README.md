## 🎯 My Current Project: **Job Placement Platform**

🚀 **Full‑Stack Job Placement Platform** — a comprehensive solution connecting **job seekers** with **recruiters** through an intuitive web interface and a powerful backend.

- **Frontend**: Built with **React.js** and **Next.js**, leveraging server‑side rendering for performance, responsive design for accessibility, and modular components for scalability.
- **Backend**: Powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, providing a RESTful API layer.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** for relational data management, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.
- **Media Storage**: **Cloudinary** for secure, scalable handling of resume uploads and other media assets.
- **Authentication**: JWT‑based auth for secure sign‑in, role management (candidate, recruiter, admin), and protected routes.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on cloud platforms for high availability and horizontal scalability.

### 💼 Key Features
- 📄 **Resume Uploader** – Upload, parse, and store candidate resumes with Cloudinary.
- 🔍 **Job Listing & Filtering** – Dynamic job board with search, filters, and pagination.
- 🔒 **Secure Auth & Roles** – Register/login, password hashing, JWT tokens, and role‑based access control.
- ⚙️ **Admin & Recruiter Dashboards** – Manage listings, view analytics, and communicate with applicants.
- 🛠️ **API Endpoints** – CRUD operations for users, jobs, applications, and admin actions.
- 📈 **Scalable Architecture** – Separation of concerns between frontend and backend, with clear API contracts.
